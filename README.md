This repo contains numerical analysis function implements by Rust and C#.

## Polynomial

### Polynomial value evaluates

Evaluates a polynomial function with given coefficients and input values. The polynomial is evaluated using the following formula: 

`y = c[0] + (x - b[0]) * (c[1] + (x - b[1]) * (c[2] + ...))`

where c is the coefficients, b is the bias and x in the input values.
